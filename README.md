# NLP_Twitter_sentiment
In this text classification project, the main focus revolves around sentiment analysis of a Tweets dataset. The
data was acquired from the Kaggle website link. The dataset is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of
Twitter, it contains the following classes: positive, negative, neutral and irrelevant, a training set and a
validation set which facilitates the process of developing and testing the classification models. <br/>
The dataset has multiple associated notebooks on Kaggle which was used as a measure to compare the
classification results of this project. Furthermore, great efforts were made to ensure the uniqueness of the
approach and methods applied in the project and the expected contribution of this project lies in its ability
to:
- Provide comprehensive evaluation and comparison of various classification algorithms in the context of
sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
- Evaluate the influence and impact of using different feature representations on model performance.
- Provide a thorough understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each model to help
practitioners select the best strategies for similar projects/tasks.
- Present a refined best-performing model showcasing the potential improvements achievable by
optimization.

While sentiment analysis on social media data is a popular and well-explored area, this project's originality
lies in its comprehensive approach to evaluating multiple algorithms, optimizing a specific model, and
providing nuanced insights. The ambition and novelty stem from the combination of methodological
diligence, diverse model evaluation metrics, and the exploration of hyperparameter optimization techniques,
collectively contributing to advancements in sentiment analysis.<br/>
This project's main objective is to deploy advanced text classification techniques to tackle the challenges
posed by sentiment analysis in Twitter data. The objectives of this project are as follows: <br/>
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning: To ensure data usability in our text classification project, robust
data preprocessing and cleaning techniques have been applied to our data.<br/>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an EDA in order to better understand and gain insight into
the data.<br/>
3. Text Representation: Apply different vectorization techniques (Count vectorizer, TF-IDF) to convert
data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. Evaluate and compare the
performance of each vectorization method across multiple classification algorithms.<br/>
4. Model Implementation: Apply logistic regression and Naive Bayes as baselines, SVM, random forest
and KNN classification algorithms to the vectorized data. Compare and evaluate the performance of
each model in handling Twitter sentiments.<br/>
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Employ RandomizedSearchCV to further optimize hyperparameters for the
best-performing model.<br/>
6. Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to asses the generalization capability of the
best-performing model. The latter ensures consistency of model performance across different subsets
of the data.<br/>
7. Confusion Matrix Analysis: To further evaluate model performance, develop confusion matrices for
each classification model, providing a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false
positives, and false negatives.<br/>
